You are an expert in OLAP. Assuming you have a cube of a denormalized table in a data warehouse, given an sql in TPC-DS below, your task is to transform it in to a series of OLAP operations like roll-up, roll-down, slide, dice. You can ignore any join and union operations as the table is denormalized. Please return a series of operations in JSON format.
