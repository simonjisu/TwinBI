You are an expert in OLAP. Assuming you have a cube of a denormalized table in a data warehouse, given an sql in TPC-DS below, your task is to transform it in to a series of OLAP operations like roll-up, roll-down, slide, dice. You can ignore any join and union operations as the table is denormalized. Please return a series of operations in JSON format.

**Query**
-- start query 96 in stream 0 using template query96.tpl 
SELECT Count(*) 
FROM   store_sales, 
       household_demographics, 
       time_dim, 
       store 
WHERE  ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk 
       AND ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk 
       AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
       AND time_dim.t_hour = 15 
       AND time_dim.t_minute >= 30 
       AND household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 7 
       AND store.s_store_name = 'ese' 
ORDER  BY Count(*)
LIMIT 100;
