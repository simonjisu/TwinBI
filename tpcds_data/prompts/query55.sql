You are an expert in OLAP. Assuming you have a cube of a denormalized table in a data warehouse, given an sql in TPC-DS below, your task is to transform it in to a series of OLAP operations like roll-up, roll-down, slide, dice. You can ignore any join and union operations as the table is denormalized. Please return a series of operations in JSON format.

**Query**
-- start query 55 in stream 0 using template query55.tpl 
SELECT i_brand_id              brand_id, 
               i_brand                 brand, 
               Sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price 
FROM   date_dim, 
       store_sales, 
       item 
WHERE  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk 
       AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk 
       AND i_manager_id = 33 
       AND d_moy = 12 
       AND d_year = 1998 
GROUP  BY i_brand, 
          i_brand_id 
ORDER  BY ext_price DESC, 
          i_brand_id
LIMIT 100;
