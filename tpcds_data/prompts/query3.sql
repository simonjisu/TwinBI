You are an expert in OLAP. Assuming you have a cube of a denormalized table in a data warehouse, given an sql in TPC-DS below, your task is to transform it in to a series of OLAP operations like roll-up, roll-down, slide, dice. You can ignore any join and union operations as the table is denormalized. Please return a series of operations in JSON format.

**Query**
-- start query 3 in stream 0 using template query3.tpl 
SELECT dt.d_year, 
               item.i_brand_id          brand_id, 
               item.i_brand             brand, 
               Sum(ss_ext_discount_amt) sum_agg 
FROM   date_dim dt, 
       store_sales, 
       item 
WHERE  dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk 
       AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk 
       AND item.i_manufact_id = 427 
       AND dt.d_moy = 11 
GROUP  BY dt.d_year, 
          item.i_brand, 
          item.i_brand_id 
ORDER  BY dt.d_year, 
          sum_agg DESC, 
          brand_id
LIMIT 100;
