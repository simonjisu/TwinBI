You are an expert in OLAP. Assuming you have a cube of a denormalized table in a data warehouse, given an sql in TPC-DS below, your task is to transform it in to a series of OLAP operations like roll-up, roll-down, slide, dice. You can ignore any join and union operations as the table is denormalized. Please return a series of operations in JSON format.

**Query**
-- start query 93 in stream 0 using template query93.tpl 
SELECT ss_customer_sk, 
               Sum(act_sales) sumsales 
FROM   (SELECT ss_item_sk, 
               ss_ticket_number, 
               ss_customer_sk, 
               CASE 
                 WHEN sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL THEN 
                 ( ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity ) * ss_sales_price 
                 ELSE ( ss_quantity * ss_sales_price ) 
               END act_sales 
        FROM   store_sales 
               LEFT OUTER JOIN store_returns 
                            ON ( sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
                                 AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number ), 
               reason
